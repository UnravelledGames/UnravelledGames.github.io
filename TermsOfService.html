<em>Adverts and In-app purchases </em><br>
You understand and accept that our services feature adverts from third party services which may utilise your data our app shares with them, to tailor the adverts in which they provide as explained in our privacy policy. You understand that we are not responsible for any of the content produced by any third party adverts or services as well as any material they may link to such as websites and apps.

We strongly advise you to read their respective privacy policy and terms and conditions when engaging with third party services. We retain the right to introduce advertising into any of our services unless previously stated that it will remain free of advertisements.<br><br>
You also understand and accept that our apps feature in-app purchases that can be purchased for real money. If you do not wish to interact with these please consider disabling them on your device. You also understand and accept that whilst most in-app purchases are restorable in connection with your Apple or Google Play account, in game currency purchases are not and should be purchased with this risk in mind. Whilst we strive to implement means of cloud saving your App's progress, this feature may not be present in the version of our apps you install and you should therefore accept the risk of in game currency loss upon app deletion or loss of data if there is no cloud save feature present.<br><br>
If the situation arises where you wish to have a purchase refunded, you understand that if on an IOS device, refunds are handled by Apple and we are unable to support in this matter.

You accept that when a refund request is made, there is no guarantee that we will issue a refund and the outcome will be resolved on a case by case basis. If you contact us for a refund, please send an email to us at UnravelledGamesLtd@gmail.com with a detailed explanation of why you are requesting a refund and any supporting screenshots of evidence you may require. We will review your request and may request further information to be provided to resolve the issue.<br><br>
Refunds may not be issued if:<br>
	-	We deem you have actively used the purchased content to benefit your app progression.<br>
	-	Deceitful requests for refunds that are not honest about the reason for a refund.<br>
	-	Evidence of save file tampering is found.<br>
	-	You lose app data through voluntary deletion of the App or changing of devices when no cloud save feature is present within the app.<br>
	-	If you request a refund due to a technical problem with the in-app purchase features we retain the right to try to fix the problematic features in question before resorting to a refund.<br>
	-	You are requesting a refund of the product more than 14 days after purchase without a valid technical reasoning behind the request such as an update we released has broken your ability to use the purchased content.<br>
	-	We are no longer supporting the app in question.<br><br>
